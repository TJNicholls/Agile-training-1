            <h2>What is Agile?</h2>
            <p>Agile is a methodology that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle.</p>
            <p>It encourages adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it promotes flexible responses to change.</p>
            <p>Agile values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.</p>

            <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
            <p>Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering high-value products.</p>
            <p>It consists of roles, events, artifacts, and rules that bind them together.</p>
            <p>Scrum promotes transparency, inspection, and adaptation, and it encourages teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress.</p>
            <p>Scrum relies on short, time-boxed iterations called sprints, where teams work to deliver potentially shippable increments of product functionality.</p>
            <p>To learn more about Scrum, you can refer to the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a>.</p>
